            A considerable amount of unmarked space in the design of the page makes it more 
            easily read and helps the user focus on the page in a comfortable manner.

            Wikipedia is available in over 300 languages, however the intro page shows the links
            to only 10 of the most available languages so as to ensure that the user is not immeaditely 
            overwhelmed with what would otherwise be too many choices.

            The main page of the NSA website practices good visual hierarchy by using 
            different fonts and colors to immeaditely catch the attention of the user to 
            the most important headlines, such as what their mission is and how they accomplish
            that.
