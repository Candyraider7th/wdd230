<h2>Overall Description of Target Audience</h2>
<p>According to Wikipedia, "The median household income in Los Alamos is $98,458, and per capita income is $54,067." While not wealthy, the average person
  in the county has a very comfortable income that gives them options; they will be more willing and have the means to travel to find services that are not available 
  or seem more effective than what can be provided in the relatively small town of 12,000 people.</p>
  <p>
  Thus, having a small buisness can be rather difficult unless they can truly provide something that is not otherwise easily accessible anywhere else, or at least competitive
  with businesses outside the town. The target audience will be any buisness owner who desires access to resources to help them succeed
